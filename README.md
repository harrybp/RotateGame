# RotateGame
### Needs a better name..

Play it [here](http://harrybp.github.io/games/rotate.html)

Another mini javascript game project, use the arrow keys to keep the ball bouncing inside the square.
There's not much to this game really and it has some weird quirks when the ball hits the square at certain angles that I never figured out!
